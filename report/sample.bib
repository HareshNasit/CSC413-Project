                   images from the marginal distributions in individual
                   domains. Since there exists an infinite set of joint
                   distributions that can arrive the given marginal
                   distributions, one could infer nothing about the joint
                   distribution from the marginal distributions without
                   additional assumptions. To address the problem, we make a
                   shared-latent space assumption and propose an unsupervised
                   image-to-image translation framework based on Coupled GANs.
                   We compare the proposed framework with competing approaches
                   and present high quality image translation results on
                   various challenging unsupervised image translation tasks,
                   including street scene image translation, animal image
                   translation, and face image translation. We also apply the

                   distribution of images in the target domain, given a set of
                   unpaired images in the source and target domains. An image
                   in the source domain might have multiple representations in
                   the target domain. Therefore, ambiguity in modeling of the
                   conditional distribution arises, specially when the images
                   in the source and target domains come from different
                   modalities. Current approaches mostly rely on simplifying
                   assumptions to map both domains into a shared-latent space.
                   Consequently, they are only able to model the
                   domain-invariant information between the two modalities.
                   These approaches usually fail to model domain-specific
                   information which has no representation in the target

                   target domain-invariant representation of the two domain.
                   The proposed framework makes it possible to map a single
                   source image into multiple images in the target domain,
                   utilizing several target domain-specific codes sampled

                   input image and an output image using a training set of
                   aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired
                   training data will not be available. We present an approach

                   to a target domain $Y$ in the absence of paired examples.
                   Our goal is to learn a mapping $G: X \rightarrow Y$ such
                   that the distribution of images from $G(X)$ is
                   indistinguishable from the distribution $Y$ using an
                   adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly
                   under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping $F:

                   from a single image. Recently, some approaches study
                   multiple style transfer; these, however, are either too slow

                   nonlinear styles to a linear latent space, enabling to merge
                   styles via linear interpolation before transferring the new
                   style to the content image. To evaluate ST-VAE, we
                   experiment on COCO for single and multiple style transfer.
                   We also present a case study revealing that ST-VAE

                   the ambient image space, which could be computationally
                   expensive and challenging to train. In this paper, we
                   propose to deploy an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent
                   space of a pretrained autoencoder for this task. The
                   pretrained autoencoder serves as both a latent code
                   extractor and an image reconstruction worker. Our model,
                   LETIT, is based on the assumption that two domains share the
                   same latent space, where latent representation is implicitly
                   decomposed as a content code and a domain-specific style
                   code. Instead of explicitly extracting the two codes and
                   applying adaptive instance normalization to combine them,
                   our latent EBM can implicitly learn to transport the source
                   style code to the target style code while preserving the
                   content code, an advantage over existing image translation
                   methods. This simplified solution is also more efficient in
                   the one-sided unpaired image translation setting.
                   Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate
                   superior translation quality and faithfulness for content
